[](/dependency)

Clojure makes it easy and efficient to create, update, and access places within
immutable, nested associative structures like maps-of-maps or vectors-of-maps.

However, I haven't found in Clojure satisfying means of *querying* these
structures.

This library contains a set of functions for converting associative structures
to in-memory databases suitable for query via Datomic-flavored [Datalog][0]
implementations like [Datomic's own][1] or [DataScript][2].

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[alandipert.intension :refer [make-db]]
         '[datascript.core      :refer [q]])

(def pets
  [{:name "George"
    :species "Parakeet"
    :age 3
    :owners ["Frege" "Peirce"]}
   {:name "Francis"
    :species "Dog"
    :age 8
    :owners ["De Morgan"]}
   {:name "Bob"
    :species "Goldfish"
    :age 1
    :owners ["Peirce"]}])
    
;; Create a set of relations based on paths into the pets map. Every relation is
;; a path followed by the value at that path.

(def pets-db (make-db pets))

;; Find the names of all the pets:

(q '[:find ?name
     :where
     [_ :name ?name]]
   pets-db)
;;=> #{["George"] ["Francis"] ["Bob"]}

;; To find each owner and how many pets each owner owns, we might write Clojure code like this:

(->> (for [p pets, o (:owners p)] {o 1})
     (apply merge-with +))
;;=> {"Peirce" 2, "Frege" 1, "De Morgan" 1}

;; It's pretty short for this example, but I find this kind of code gets hard to
;; follow, particularly with deeper structures. I find queries involving joins
;; and filters especially difficult to express adequately in this way. Here's
;; how I would prefer to do it, with Datalog:

(->> (q '[:find ?owner (count ?pet)
          :where
          [?pet :owners _ ?owner]]
       pets-db)
     (into {}))
;;=> {"Peirce" 2, "Frege" 1, "De Morgan" 1}

;; Create another set of relations, this time prefixing each with the path
;; itself. This is useful for updating structures with update-in based on query
;; results.

(def pets-db2 (make-db pets {:paths? true}))

;; Find the paths to every pet's age over 2:

(def age-paths
  (->> (q '[:find ?path
            :where
            [?path _ :age ?age]
            [(> ?age 2)]]
          pets-db2)
       (map first)))
;;=> ([0 :age] [1 :age])
     
(reduce #(update-in %1 %2 inc) pets age-paths)
;;=> A vector of maps in which George and Francis are now 4 and 9, respectively.
```

## How it works

Consider this map:

```clojure
(def m1
  {:color "red"
   :year 1992
   :sound "ringing"})
```

The same information could be represented as a set of vectors, or ordered pairs:

```clojure
(def m2
  #{[:color "red"]
    [:year 1992]
    [:sound "ringing"]})
```

A set of ordered pairs is equivalent to a map in that the `[key, value]`
associations are distinct within both structures. The map is superior for most
programming purposes in that given a key, the corresponding value can be found
efficiently.

However, the set-of-tuples structure has its own special affordance: it can be
viewed as set of 2-place [relations][3].

The advantage of a relational view of the structure is that it can be
queried directly easily with a popular dialect of Datalog.

For example, the following Datomic-flavored Datalog query finds the values for
`?v` in all of the relations starting with `:color`:

```clojure
[:find ?v :where [:color ?v]]
```

## Differences from specter

[specter][4] is another library that was also created with the goal making it
easier to work with nested structures in Clojure.

Unlike specter, intension supplies no means for updating structures â€” only
querying them using a (separate) Datalog implementation.  Also, it's only
possible to query maps and vectors currently.
