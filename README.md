Clojure makes it easy and efficient to create, update, and access places within
immutable, nested associative structures like maps-of-maps or vectors-of-maps.

However, Clojure doesn't help much with **querying** these structures,
particularly when there are relationships across elements within the structure.
As a result, programmers are often compelled to implement bespoke query engines
and DSLs on a per-application basis.

This library contains a set of functions for converting associative structures
to in-memory databases suitable for query via Datomic-flavored [Datalog][0]
implementations like [Datomic's own][1] or [DataScript][2].

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[alandipert.intension :refer [make-db]]
         '[datascript.core      :refer [q]])

(def pets
  [{:name "George"
    :species "Parakeet"
    :age 3
    :owners ["Frege" "Peirce"]}
   {:name "Francis"
    :species "Dog"
    :age 8
    :owners ["De Morgan"]}
   {:name "Bob"
    :species "Goldfish"
    :age 1
    :owners ["Peirce"]}])
    
;; Create a set of relations based on paths into the pets map. Every relation
;; contains the path, followed by the value at that path.

(def pets-db (make-db pets))

;; Find the names of all the pets:

(q '[:find ?name
     :where
     [_ :name ?name]]
   pets-db)
;;=> #{["George"] ["Francis"] ["Bob"]}

;; To find each owner and how many pets each owner owns, we could write Clojure code like this:

(reduce
  (fn [m pet]
     (reduce #(update %1 %2 (fnil + 0) 1) m (get pet :owners)))
  {}
  pets)
;;=> {"Peirce" 2, "Frege" 1, "De Morgan" 1}

;; I find that code hard to follow, which is why I made this library. Here's how
;; I would prefer to do it, with Datalog:

(q '[:find ?owner (count ?pet)
     :where
     [?pet :owners _ ?owner]]
   pets-db)
;;=> (["Peirce" 2] ["Frege" 1] ["De Morgan" 1])

;; Create another set of relations, this time prefixing each with the path
;; itself. This is useful for updating structures with update-in based on query
;; results.

(def pets-db2 (make-db pets {:paths? true}))

;; Find the paths to every pet's age over 2:

(def age-paths
  (->> (q '[:find ?path
            :where
            [?path _ :age ?age]
            [(> ?age 2)]]
          pets-db2)
       (map first)))
     
;; Return a new map with every pet's age over 2 inc'd:

(reduce #(update-in %1 %2 inc) pets age-paths)
;;=> a map in which George and Francis are now 4 and 9, respectively.
```

## Theory of operation

### Maps as sets of pairs

Consider the following map:

```clojure
(def m1
  {:color "red"
   :year 1992
   :sound "ringing"})
```

The same information could be represented as a set of vectors, or ordered pairs:

```clojure
(def m2
  #{[:color "red"]
    [:year 1992]
    [:sound "ringing"]})
```

A set of ordered pairs is equivalent to a map in that the `[key, value]`
associations are distinct within both structures. The map is superior for most
programming purposes in that given a key, the corresponding value can be found
efficiently.

However, the set-of-tuples structure has its own special affordance: it can be
viewed as set of 2-place [relations][3].

The advantage of a relational view of the structure is that it can be
queried directly with a popular dialect of Datalog.

For example, the following Datomic-flavored Datalog query finds the values for
`?v` in all of the relations starting with `:color`:

```clojure
[:find ?v
 :where [:color ?v]]
```

### Cardinality of associations

In a map, there can only be one association between a key and a value, so the
above query will only ever return one value for `?v`.  In other applications of
Datalog, such as against a Datomic database, a similar query might yield multiple
values for `?v` if the *cardinality* of the `:color` relation is "many".

### Deep structures

Any k-deep associative structure can be represented as a set of relations
varying in arity between 2 and k.  A path into a nested structure corresponds to
a relation in a set.

### Associativity of sets

It's not especially important for the purposes of this library that sets be
queryable. Most of the time I need to query data from a [JSON][5] source, and JSON
does not support sets. However, I learned while developing the
library that sets like `#{:a :b :c}` can be viewed as sets of 1-place relations
like these:

```clojure
#{[:a] [:b] [:c]}
```

Under this scheme, the map `{:xs #{1 2 3}}` is represented as this set of
2-place relations:

```clojure
#{[:xs 1] 
  [:xs 2]
  [:xs 3]}
```

A variant of `assoc` can then be defined that can operate on sets:

```clojure
(defn assoc* 
  [coll k v]
  "Like assoc but works also on sets."
  (if (set? coll)
    (conj (disj coll k) v)
    (assoc coll k v)))
```

A variant of `update-in` can be defined that works on structures
possibly containing sets:

```clojure
(defn update-in*
  "Like update-in but works also on sets."
  ([m [k & ks] f & args]
   (if ks
     (assoc* m k (apply update-in* (get m k) ks f args))
     (assoc* m k (apply f (get m k) args)))))
```

Combining our scheme for representing paths into sets and `update-in*`, we can
now (arguably meaningfully?) "update" values into structures containing sets:

```clojure
(update-in* {:xs #{1 2 3}} [:xs 3] inc) ;=> {:xs #{1 2 4}}
```

> Note: Clojure already supports `get` on sets: `(get #{1 2 3} 2)` is `2`.

Relations representing paths to sets can be thought of as having "many"
cardinality.

## Differences from spectre

[spectre][6] is another library that was also created with the goal making it
easier to work with nested structures in Clojure.

Unlike spectre, intension supplies no means for updating structures â€” only
querying them using a (separate) Datalog implementation.  Also, it's only
possible to query maps and vectors currently.

## Ideas for improvement

It would be useful to support "wildcards."  Sometimes you don't know how deep
the path is to some key/value in the structure you're interested in - you just
know you're interested in the shallowest value for `:name` or whatever.

It might be good to create another function, like `make-meta-db`, that returned
a database of convenience relations generated at some extra expense. The meta db
might contain 3-place relations for every distinct key/value regardless of
depth, prefixed by path. Meta data could be joined against data generated by
`make-db` on the path value.
